📘 LLM Safety Category Classifier (Mini Safety Model)
---

A lightweight, fast, and fully reproducible project that classifies text into safety categories such as hate, violence, fraud, sexual content, self-harm, and benign.
This project uses OpenAI embeddings + a simple ML classifier to build a small but effective safety filter.

🚀 1. Problem Statement

Modern AI applications must detect unsafe or harmful content before generating responses.
Large safety models are powerful but often expensive and slow to experiment with.

Goal:
Build a small, fast, efficient safety classifier that categorizes text into:
- hate
- violence
- fraud
- sexual_content
- self_harm
- benign


This model is ideal for:
- Prototyping safety filters
- Research & learning
- Demonstrating end-to-end ML pipeline skills
- Resume/GitHub portfolio projects
- Fast on-device or API-side content moderation
